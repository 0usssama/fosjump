### How to contribute to **FOS Jump** ?
There are three main ways to proceed by for anyone who would like to add or modify any information:

1. Making a pull request
	* This website is static. It was generated by a simple tool, let's call it: [FOS_Jump_Generator]().
2. Via github issues: 
    * Adding links by commenting to [newProjectLinks issue](http://github.com/fos-contrib/fos-contrib.github.io/issues/projectLinks) or [otherLinks issue](http://github.com/fos-contrib/fos-contrib.github.io/issues/otherLinks)
    * Modifying or proposing something else by [creating a new issue](http://github.com/fos-contrib/fos-contrib.github.io/issues)
3. Sending an email to fos-contrib@protonmail.com (if you don't have a github account)


**IMPORTANT**: Only links to FOS projects that are new-commers-friendly are accepted in *the list*. 

Any type of contribution is welcomed.
