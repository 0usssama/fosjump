Anyone can add:

* Other FOS Projects with **good how-to-contribute readings**;
* Website that help finding projects FOS Projects to participate to;
* Videos about the subject;
* Or propose any other idea for improving this platform.

There are three main ways to proceed:

1. Making a pull request to the ([github project]()).
2. Via github issues: 
    * Adding links by commenting to [newProjectLinks issue](http://github.com/fos-contrib/fos-contrib.github.io/issues/projectLinks) or [otherLinks issue](http://github.com/fos-contrib/fos-contrib.github.io/issues/otherLinks)
    * Modifying or proposing something else by [creating a new issue](http://github.com/fos-contrib/fos-contrib.github.io/issues)
3. Or sending an email to fos-contrib@protonmail.com (if you don't have a github account)


**IMPORTANT**: Only links to FOS projects that are new-commers-friendly are accepted in [the main list](index.html). 

Any type of contribution is welcomed.
